Javascript Exercises for Beginners
===================================


This is a small set of javascript exercises which are configured with testcases so they can be implemented and tested while being worked on.

### Getting started

You will need to clone this repo on your local machine. Alternatively you can download the zip file from the sidebar on the right.

Once cloned you will need to run `npm install` in the terminal (You need to have Node + npm configured for this)

Then run `grunt` to start the watching process (you need to have grunt installed for this)

Open the `exercises` folder in your code editor. Split screens between the editor and the terminal.

Edit the file, on saving it will run jshint (to ensure you have correctly written your javascript) and then unit test the function.
